 When ever we create new user automatically  copy [.bash_logout , .bash_profile, .bashrc ] from [ #ls -al /etc/skel ] to new user home directory .
 
 :- bash_history ->  it content history of command run by user also it create automatically when we logout first time from the user .
  #cat .bash_history
  
:- .bashrc  source from the /etc/bshrc files, it also have room castor aliases & function also it executed every time when new shell login.

:- .bash_profile :-  this file is also executed when the user login first time shell . it source from .bashrc file.

with the help of both .bashrc and .bash_profile file we can permanently set alises, function, variable run always  when user login.
