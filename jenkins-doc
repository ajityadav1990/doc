l 1 - Introduction and Getting Started=========================
Jenkins 
  - java application
  - used for continuous integration and continuous delivery
Step 1 : Download Jenkins war file - https://jenkins.io/
Step 2 : Place the war file into any location on your system
Step 3 : goto  terminal
   - goto folder where jenkins.war is
   - java -jar jenkins.war
Step 4 : goto browser - http://localhost:8080 (Jenkins window should show up)
Step 5 : install required plugins
====================Tutorial 2 - How to setup Jenkins on Tomcat=========================
Why?
Running Jenkins standalone (jetty/winstone) vs Running Jenkins on Tomcat
Pre-requisite
***Tomcat 5 or above***
***java(7 or above) should be available***
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqpmH...)
Step 1 : Download Tomcat 
Step 2 : Unzip and place tomcat folder at any location
Step 3 : Copy/Place the jenkins.war file inside tomcat/webapps folder
Step 4 : Goto commandpromt (cmd) - windows  |  terminal - mac
  - goto tomcat/bin directory
  - make all files executable : chmod +x *.sh
Step 5 : Start Tomcat : ./startup.sh
  (to shutdown tomcat : ./shutdown.sh)
Step 6 : verify if tomcat started : browser - http://localhost:8080
Step 7 : verify if jenkins is running on tomcat : http://localhost:8080/jenkins
*** To start jenkins (standalone) on a diff port***
java -jar jenkins.war - - httpPort=9090
==================== Tutorial 3 - How to change Home Directory=================================
Jenkins Home Directory contains:

Why:
-To move jenkins home dir to a location that has enough disk space
-Project requirements
Step 1 : Check your current home directory
Step 2 : Create a new folder (which will be new home dir)
Step 3 : Copy all data from old dir to new dir
Step 4 : change env variable - JENKINS_HOME and set to new dir
 goto terminaal
 export JENKINS_HOME=/Users/raghav/Desktop/Tools/Jenkins/JenkinsHome/
Step 5 : restart Jenkins
========================Tutorial 4 - How to use CLI - command line interface============================== 
Step 1 : start Jenkins
Step 2 : goto Manage Jenkins - Configure Global Security - enable security
Step 3 : goto - http://localhost:8080/cli/
Step 4 : download jerkins-cli jar. Place at any location.
Step 5 : test the jenkins command line is working
=========================Tutorial 5 - How to create Users + Manage + Assign Roles==========================
Jenkins authentication and authorization
———————————
How to create New Users
How to configure users
How to create new roles
How to assign users to roles
How to Control user access on projects
Step 1 : Create new users
Step 2 : Configure users
Step 3 : Create and manage user roles Roles Strategy Plugin - download - restart jenkins
Step 4 : Manage Jenkins - Configure Global Security - Authorisation - Role Based Strategy
Step 5 : Create Roles and Assign roles to users
Step 6 : Validate authorization and authentication are working properly
================================Tutorial 6 - Basic Configurations=========================================
Step 1 : Goto Manage Jenkins - Configure System
Step 2 : Get a basic understanding of common/basic configurations
========================Tutorial 7 - Getting started with JOBS============================================
1. How to create a basic JOB in Jenkins
2. Basic job configurations
2. How to run the Job remotely
4. How to chain Job Execution
Step 1 : Jenkins - New Item - add details 
Step 2 : How to trigger the job remotely
Step 3 : How to chain job executions
============================ Tutorial 8  Jenkins integration with GIT (SCM)===================================

1. Create a java program and run it through command line
2. Create a Jenkins job to run the java program
3. Add this program/project to Git
4. Jenkins - add git plugin
5. Configure Jenkins job to trigger the execution when a change is pushed to GitHub
_________________________________________________________

Step 1 : Create a java program
Step 2 : Compile from command line
   javac “name of .java class”
      java “name of class without extension .java”
Step 3 : Create a Jenkins job to run this program
Step 4 : Add the project to Git and GitHub
Step 5 : Configure Jenkins job to trigger build on Git commit
Note : If you get :
'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
Try this:
When creating a new item in Jenkins, you can choose the jdk in the General tab (execute multiple builds if necessary option), either you click on System or the jdk that you have installed on that moment (e.g. jdk1.8.0_181).

Step 1
Start Jenkins
Step 2
Install Plugin
(Deploy Plugin)
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/J...
You can also goto your Jenkins on browser and
- Manage Jenkins - Plugins Manager - Click on Available tab and search for deploy to container
Add to Jenkins
Step 3
Create a Build JOB in Jenkins
Step 4
Add Post-build Action Deploy war/ear to container
(add values to the fields) 
sample war file - https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-...
Step 5
In tomcat-users.xml add user for DEPLOYMENT
user username="deployer" password="deployer" roles="manager-script" /

What is Pipeline in Jenkins ?
Pipeline - is a workflow with group of events or jobs that are chained and integrated with each other in sequence.

Difference between Build and Delivery Pipeline:

At a high level you can say Build pipeline has a smaller scope in terms of the entire process of software dev and delivery whereas delivery pipeline has a much broader scope. Also when we say delivery, build pipeline will be one of its components.
Build Pipeline provides a view of the upstream and downstream jobs setup for the build process (typically)
Whereas Delivery Pipeline gives the visualization of the complete Delivery Process that may include Build, Deploy, Test. In the delivery pipeline view, you can see each of these sections in a separate box.
