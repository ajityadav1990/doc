        Password : admin (not fix )

To see home page ( first page ) of tomcat

http://localhost:8080(tomcat port number ) in url


in the time of installing tomcat always go 

Service /apache tomcat 9.0 tomcat   --> property/change  ( automatily to manual )

if you do not this it will always start time of booting process	.
	
After installing tomcat we get some folder.	


/bin   :- it content many file but most important file is Tomcat 9 which we use for start tomcat.

/conf  :- it also content many file but mostly we use Server.xml to Chang the port number & we use tomcat-user to add new user & password get into 
          the admin consol and to know  username & password.
		  
/lib   :- along with tomcat installing we will get some contener the important file like 	
          serlet.api   represent  serlet API
          JSP-api      represent  jsp API
          Serlet container name is catalina		  
		  JSP      Container name  Jasper
		  
/Webapps  :- it is very important ,it contant default webapplication if you deploy web application you will place in /Wabapps folder.
              we use always /Webapps folder for deployment java web server in tomcat.

JDK ---->

Java Development kit (JDK) allows you to code and run java program. it is possible that you install multiple JDK on the same PC.

JSP --->

 ( Java Server Page ) is a technology that helps software developer create dynamically generated web pagse
  JSP is similar to PHP & ASP but use for java programming language.
  
 Java Servlet :-

  Install tomcat on EC2
  
  yum install tomcat8-webapps
  yum install  tomcat8-admin-webapps
  yum install  tomcat8-docs-webapp
  
  cd /usr/share/tomcat8/
  ls
  fuser -v -n tcp 8080
  netstat -na | grep 8080
  
  Service tomcat8 statrt
  service tomcat8  status
  chkconfig tomcat8 on
  in ec2 URL

web server :  web server is responsible to run web application.

Tomcat( web server ) : for run web application we need some spacial software which is tomcat ( web server ) for responsible to manage
and executed servelet a JSP.

Web container :-  web contaner is responsible to manage and executed servelet a JSP 

Servlet Container( Catalina) is use for manage and execute servlet component.

JSP Container ( JASPER ) is use for manage and execute JSP Component.

Java  

Core Java ->  we can only use for create stand alone application

Advance Java ->  we can create web  application i adavance java we have 3 technology


 |
 |
 ------------JDBC
 |
 |
 |__________Servlet
 |
 |
 |---------JSPS
 
 in java we have 3 edition 
 
 1} java standard Edition ( J2SE | JSE ) - core Java  (JDBC)
 
 2}  Java Enterprise = Servlet & JSPS
 
 3} Java micro edition ( like mobile application )
 
 
 example      { Servlet do all this internal action ]
